## Spark vs Hadoop Comparison

---

## 1 Hadoop vs. Spark Difference:.

* **Hadoop**: Primarily relies on MapReduce.
* **Spark**: Uses in-memory processing. 

* **Hadoop**: Due to its reliance on disk I/O, Hadoop is typically slower than Spark. 
* **Spark**: Is faster because of its in-memory computation model. 

* **Hadoop**: Writing MapReduce programs can be more complex
* **Spark**: Provides higher-level APIs in multiple languages (Java, Scala, Python, R), making it easier to write programs.
