# 1.1 Hadoop vs. Spark Difference:.

**Hadoop**: Primarily relies on MapReduce. 
**Spark**: Uses in-memory processing.

**Hadoop**: Due to its reliance on disk I/O, Hadoop is typically slower than Spark. 
**Spark**: Is faster because of its in-memory computation model. 

**Spark**: Provides higher-level APIs in multiple languages (Java, Scala, Python, R), making it easier to write programs. 
**Hadoop**: Writing MapReduce programs can be more complex
